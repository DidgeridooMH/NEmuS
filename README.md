# NEmuS
NEmuS is an NES emulator written in C++ using the SDL libraries. Cross compatibilty is a main focus during the development and no platform specific code should be pushed without OS guards and sufficient workarounds for other platforms. Cycle specific timings isn't as much of a priority as getting more game support for the project. Any who wish to use, copy, or modify any of this project can do so freely(check LICENSE for more details).
